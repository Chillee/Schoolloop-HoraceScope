As students, we worry endlessly about our grades. What do I need to get on the final? How much will the test I just bombed mess up my grade? If I make up that zero, what grade will I have?

School Loop HoraceScope (excuse the pun) is a convenient way to answer all these questions. Instead of adding up all your points by hand, HoraceScope takes care of all the tedious details for you, and lets you easily see your potential new grade.

Features:
- Works on both weighted and unweighted grades.
- Allows you to edit the score of past homework assignments, quizzes, tests, etc.
- Works with extra credit
- Allows you to add new assignments.
- Allows you to add a finals category

Instructions:

Editing past grades:
Simply click on one of your past grades and change it, either through the keyboard or the arrow keys.

Adding new grades:
Click on the New Assignment button, click the dropdown menu to change any categories, and then change grades freely.

Adding a finals category:
1. Check the Add Final Categories check mark. Your grade may drop immediately, but don't panic. The program just assumes you currently have a 0 in a finals category (sure to lower anybody's grade). 
2. Now click on the New Assignment button and select the finals category.
3. Now you can change your finals grades around!


Note: Any changes made are purely hypothetical, and will not change your actual grade.
